Below you will find links for downloading versions of WinHasher. As always, we strongly recommend that you use the latest version of WinHasher whenever possible. Since WinHasher may be considered a security application, we do not recommend the use of older deprecated releases unless you encounter a problem with the latest release that you cannot work around. Of course, if you encounter such a problem, we strongly suggest you report the issue in our [Issue tracker](https://github.com/gpfjeff/winhasher/issues) so we can fix it.

Older versions of WinHahser are currently unavailable for download. Once we release another new version, we should be able to maintain a running list of older download links once again.

The following links point to the latest version of the WinHasher download files hosted on Google Drive. The GnuPG signature and SHA-1 hash for each file can also be found below. Jeff's current GnuPG signature can be found [here](https://www.gpf-comics.com/gnupg.php).
